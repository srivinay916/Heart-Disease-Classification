This project builds a complete machine learning pipeline to classify heart disease using a 303-record clinical dataset. After preprocessing and scaling the data, a Random Forest classifier is trained using a stratified 70/30 split. The model achieves around 79% accuracy with strong recall for detecting heart disease, making it effective for risk identification. Evaluation includes a classification report, confusion matrix, pair plots, parallel coordinates, calibration curves, and feature importance analysis. Key predictors include chest pain type, ST depression, and maximum heart rate. The project also explores single-tree visualization and outlines future improvements such as tuning, feature engineering, and explainability.
